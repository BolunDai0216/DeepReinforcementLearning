## SAC

The soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is adapted from [OpenAI Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/sac.html). Additional changes to the training are implemented inspired by [CreateAMind](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8vgLGcpsWkF89ma7T2twRA). A video showing the trained model can be found at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hUTnoNfTn8).
